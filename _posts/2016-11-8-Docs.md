## Running the model

## Version 6

Edit *Makefile* to contain the correct compiler flags.

### Compiling

Find *makegcm* in the folder **/[user path]/mgcm-v6/**

Run *makegcm* with required parameters, e.g.:\n
	`> ./makegcm -r 31x25 -t 3 -s 1 -c`

This results in output compiled file *mgcm* located in **/mgcm-v6/bin/*mgcm***

### Preparing to run

Copy compiled *mgcm* into test directory e.g. **m001**

Copy reference files into test directory:
	*callphys.def*
	*diagfi.def*
	*model.input_ref*
	*traceur.def*

Copy run script into test directory:
	*runscript*

### Running from desktop

Call model with *runscript*:
	`> ./runscript &`

### Running from cluster



Requested output variables will be written to a netCDF file *diagfi.nc* in test directory.

View results with *ncview*:
	`> ncview -no_auto_overlay diagfi.nc`
